In computer science, a tree structure refers to the organization of data in memory, in a logical and hierarchical way using an n-ary tree algorithmic structure. This organization makes the consultation and manipulation of stored data more efficient. The most common uses are :
This graphical interface thus presents a hierarchical view of the information. Each element (often called branch or node) can have a number of sub-elements. This is often represented as an indented list.
The tree view often appears in file management applications, where they allow the user to navigate through the directories of the file system. They are also used to present hierarchical data, such as an XML document.
So my goal is to create a volume management application using tree techniques, and to do so I used the notion of the n-aire tree, and I used my C programming skills to create this application called ARBO-GV
ARBO-GV is an easy to use computer program that allows you to manage volumes with different methods.

Practical and easy to use this program does not require a great knowledge in computer science to be able to master it and it can be used by any interested person.
The instructions of the project

The project talks about the creation of a volume management application using the n-aire tree, that is to say, there must be a program that presents several services that can present the work that the user would like to have.

The different tasks that the program must perform are :
- Adding a new volume
- Deleting a volume
- Managing a volume
- Display of all recorded volumes
- Adding a node
- Displaying the contents of a node
- Copying a node
- Moving a node
- Rename a node
- Deleting a node
- Calculate the number of occurrences of a node
